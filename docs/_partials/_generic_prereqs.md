#### Pre-requisites

You need a clean installation of Kratix for this section. The simplest way to do
so is by running the quick-start script from within the Kratix directory.

```bash
./scripts/quick-start.sh --recreate
```

Alternatively, you can go back to [Installing Kratix](./installing-kratix) and follow the appropriate guide.

For the context of this guide, we will assume the setup from [Installing
Kratix](./installing-kratix) and that the following environment variables are set:


```bash
export PLATFORM="kind-platform"
export WORKER="kind-worker"
```

If your setup is different, update the commands accordingly.

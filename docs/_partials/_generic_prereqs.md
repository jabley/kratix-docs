#### Pre-requisites

You need a clean installation of Kratix for this section. The simplest way to do
so is by running the quick-start script from within the Kratix directory.

```bash
./scripts/quick-start.sh --recreate
```

Alternatively, you can go back to [Installing Kratix](./installing-kratix) and follow the appropriate guide.

Also, make sure to that the following environment variables are set:

```bash
export PLATFORM="kind-platform"
export WORKER="kind-worker"
```

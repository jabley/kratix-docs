# Contributing to the Marketplace
## Promises

The Kratix Marketplace is a place where you can share and find Promises, built
by the community, for the community. If you'd like to contribute a Promise, you
can do so by creating a Pull Request to the [Kratix
Docs repository](https://github.com/syntasso/kratix-docs). The list of Promises
is stored in the `src/data/promise-data.json` file.

You can add your Promise to the list using the following template:

```typescript
{
  "name": "Promise Name",
  "description": "Promise Description",
  "url": "https://github.com/org/repository",
  "logoUrl": "image.svg",
  "categories": ["Category 1", "Category 2"]
}
```

### Structure

There's no specific structure required for your Promise to be accepted, neither a
particular repository where the Promise should be stored. For inspiration, you can take
a look at the [Promises authored by Syntasso](https://github.com/syntasso/kratix-marketplace).

### When will my Promise be available?

Once the PR is submitted, it will be reviewed and tested by the Kratix team. Once merged,
it should be available on the Marketplace within minutes.

## How to contribute a Pipeline Image

Similar to Promises, you can contribute Images to the Marketplace by creating a Pull
Request to the [Kratix Docs repository](https://github.com/syntasso/kratix-docs). The
list of Promises is stored in the `src/data/pipeline-image-data.json` file.

You can add your Image to the list using the following template:

```typescript
{
  "name": "Pipeline Image Name",
  "description": "Pipeline Image Description",
  "url": "https://github.com/org/repository",
  "logoUrl": "image.svg",
  "categories": ["Category 1", "Category 2"]
}
```

The acceptance process is the same as for Promises.
